<Card title="FAQ" icon="question" horizontal="true">
  **Can I remove followers from my profile?** <br />
  
Currently, you cannot remove followers from your profile. If you do not want followers or other learners to view your profile, consider changing your profile visibility to _Private_. This prevents anyone from seeing your profile or learning activity in ProLearn.
