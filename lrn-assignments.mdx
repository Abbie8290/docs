## What is the Difference between Assigned and Required Learning?
There are two types of assignments within ProLearn:
- **Assigned Learning** - These types of assignments are assigned to you (or a Group you are in) by another member within your organization that has the permissions to do so, such as your manager or a Group Admin.

<Card title="Example:" horizontal="true"> 
Your manager reads an article on ways to innovate in your current field. She assigns it to you and recommends you complete the article by next Friday. She can track whether or not you have completed the article.
</Card>

- **Required Learning** - These assignments come into Degreed from an external source and cannot be manually assigned or marked as completed from within Degreed. Your organization (or a 3rd party) may require you complete these assignments to maintain necessary company compliance policies or adhere to any relevant or mandatory requirements. These assignments can be organization-wide or specific to your job role. When the assignment is completed and verified on the external site, the associated content card is updated in Degreed and marked as complete.

<Card title="Example:" horizontal="true">
Every member of your organization is required to complete a _Preventing Workplace Harassment_ course to remain Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) compliant. You must have the course completed by the end of the month. This course is mandatory to continue employment at your organization.
