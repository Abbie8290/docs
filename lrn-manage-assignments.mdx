Assignment cards show when the assignment is due and indicate if the assignment is Required or Assigned. Relevant content details are also available such as the Content Title, Content Type, Duration, and Provider.

The color of the labels and icons reflect the due date status for the assignment:
* **Red**: The assignment is overdue.
* **Yellow**: The assignment is due in less than 31 days.
* **Grey**: The due date for the assignment is over 31 days. 

The **Home** page only displays a portion of your assignments, priortizing assignments that are overdue, due soon, or Required. For a full list of your assignments, view your **Assignments** page.

## The Assignment Page
The **Assignments** page contains all of your active and completed assignments. Access the **Assignments** page by clicking the **Assignments** option in the navigation panel.
