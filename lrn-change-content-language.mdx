Changing your ProLearn content language does not translate content. It more prominently displays content available in the selected language to you. Content items in the selected language are prioritized in your feed, search results, and browse results. Content may still appear in languages outside of your set preferred language(s).

  **Why is content in my feed in languages that my Content Language is not set to?** <br />
  
 Your preferred language is a priority for content suggestions, but it is not a filter. You might see other languages in your feed based on the skills you are following, Groups you are a member of, your followers, and your recommendations. Even if you change your content language, you may continue to see suggested content items in other languages based on relevancy.
