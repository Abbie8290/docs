description: "Partner Connections in Supply Connect enable companies to easily share tickets between suppliers, customers, and haulers."
---
Supply Connect organizations can create partnerships with other companies by either establishing a connection with a company that is already using Supply Connect or by inviting a company to create a Supply Connect account.

Once a partnership is created, [Sharing Rules](/supply-sharing-rules) control how ticket information is shared between the two companies.
## Partnership Statuses
You can view the current partnership status your organization has with another company in the Manage Partner Connection grid. Three statuses are available:
* _Pending_ : An invitation was sent to onboard this partner onto the Supply Connect platform. 
* _Connected_ : A partnership connection is established and both companies have active Supply Connect accounts.
* _Not Connected_ : The partner does not have an active Supply Connect account. Your organization can create pseudo-company partnerships with no intentions of becoming connected as a way to maintain records within Supply Connect.
