title: "Configure Ticket Sharing Rules"
description: "You can create sharing rules to control how ticket information is shared to a company that your organization has a partnership with. Multiple sharing rules can be created for each partner."

<Note>
You can only configure sharing rules with an established Partner Connection. See [Partner Connections](/supply-partner-connections) for details on how to add a new partner connection within Supply Connect.

5. Turn on the **Enable** toggle to activate the rule upon saving.
6. In the Ticket Match Criteria section, specify what tickets should be shared with this partner by specifying the following categories: Customers (required), Carriers, Projects, Products, and Suppliers. <br/>
<Warning> Only tickets matching **all** the criteria indicated are included when tickets are shared with the partner. For example, if **Supplier** is set to _Supplier A_ and **Customer** is set to _Customer B_, only the tickets from _Supplier A_ for _Customer B_ are shared to this connection. Tickets from _Supplier A_ for _Customer C_ are not shared.</Warning>
7. In the Shared Areas section, use the available checkboxes to identify the areas of the ticket that can be shared with this partner. The **Share** options allow that area to be available to the partner. The **Re-shareable** options determine if your partner is also able to share those areas with their own partner connections within Supply Connect.
8. Select the **Save Rule** button.
9. Use the **Run Rule Now** button to push all eligible tickets to be immediately shared with your partner (based on the indicated **Effective Date**). <br/>
