title: "Ticket Tags"
description: "Ticket Tags allow buyers to specify their own identifiers (IDs and Descriptions) as tags for specific objects shared on a ticket. The defined tag replaces the supplier's information on the shared ticket, when retrieved in Accept Materials. This enables a buyer company to better track and identify their tickets in Supply Connect (by using IDs and descriptors that are specific to their company) and maintain consistency between multiple suppliers."

<Info>The tag values are mapped to the appropriate object on the retrieved ticket. Original ticket values are still stored and available to the supplier.</Info>
Ticket tags are configured per supplier company, and ticket values for all applicable object are stored in the system when a ticket record is shared. Buyer companies can then assign a tag value to the appropriate ticket value.

Alternatively, Ticket Tag records can be created before a ticket is shared by a supplier if the buyer already knows the supplier-specific Code and/or ID value(s) for the corresponding object.

Tags can be configured for the following ticket objects:
- Product
- Carrier
- Vehicle Types
- Origin Plant
- Project
<Note>Both **Ticket Values** and **Tag Values** are included in the Bulk Export file.</Note>
